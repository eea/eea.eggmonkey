Additional eea.eggmonkey utilities
==================================

src cleanup
-----------

By adding the eea.eggmonkey as extension to buildout, it will 
automatically check the sources folder for packages that have
a repository that is different from the current sources section.
This is useful in case you migrate repositories. Notice that you 
need to add the eea.eggmonkey extension before you do the migration

package new version check
-------------------------
The bin/check_latest script will take all the eggs in your buildout
and check pypi for the latest versions. You can create a file called
.skipped_packages, where you place a package name per line.
